# odin-tic-tac-toe
The Tic Tac Toe project from The Odin Project's Javascript Course

This was a really hard one! Mostly because we had to be wary of scope and encapsulation. 

I understand it though, to protect our code and have variables and data not be accessed so easily, we need to be able to encapsulate. 

The difficulty with this assignment came with factory functions and closure! Closure!!! I can't say I 100% get it yet, but I understand that you need to be able to discern when variables are global or local, and you need to be able to set up your code so that functions can access different variables when needed, even if that function is technically closed. 

Examples of this in this assignment was with the isGameOver variable which told my program if the game was over, and the assignment of the player's names. I had to consider very carefully how to place those variables so 1. they would still be encapsulated and therefore protected, and 2. they would store memory and not reset every time I called the function or loop.

A great practice assignment! I even practiced some media queries, so that my tic tac toe game wouldn't be completed ugly on mobile.
